If statement referred to:
 if (first == test1) if (second == test2) value = 5; else value = 6;

Question 1:
describe in your own words how the compiler interprets this statement;
In proper layout the statement is interpreted as:
  if (first == test1)
    {
      if (second == test2)
      {
        value = 5;
      }
        else value = 6;
    }

Question 2:
rewrite this statement using the correct layout (no additional syntax
elements may be used);

For the non-default interpretation we could write
  if (first == test1)
    {
      if (second == test2)
      {
        value = 5;
      }
    }
  else
    value = 6;
Which checks the first if statement, and otherwise goes to else.

Q What is the flaw
instead of the interpretation as used by the compiler: how would you change the statement so that the `non-default' interpretation is used?
The flaw is the lack of proper syntax.
